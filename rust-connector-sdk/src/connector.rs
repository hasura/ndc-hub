/// Connectors using this library should implement this trait.
///
///
/// It provides methods which implement the standard endpoints
/// defined by the specification: capabilities, schema, query, mutation,
/// query/explain, and mutation/explain.
///
/// In addition, it introduces names for types to manage
/// state and configuration (if any), and provides any necessary context
/// for observability purposes (metrics, logging and tracing).
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// Connectors encapsulate data sources, and likely require configuration
/// (connection strings, web service tokens, etc.). The NDC specification
/// does not discuss this sort of configuration, because it is an
/// implementation detail of a specific connector, but it is useful to
/// adopt a convention here for simplified configuration management.
///
/// Configuration is specified as JSON, validated, and stored in a binary
/// format.
///
/// This trait defines two types for managing configuration:
///
/// - [`Connector::RawConfiguration`] defines the type of unvalidated, raw
///   configuration.
/// - [`Connector::Configuration`] defines the type of validated
///   configuration. Ideally, invalid configuration should not be representable
///   in this form.
///
/// ## State
///
/// In addition to configuration, this trait defines a type for state management:
///
/// - [`Connector::State`] defines the type of any unserializable runtime state.
///
/// State is distinguished from configuration in that it is not provided directly by
/// the user, and would not ordinarily be serializable. For example, a connection string
/// would be configuration, but a connection pool object created from that
/// connection string would be state.
