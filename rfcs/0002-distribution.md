# Connector Package Distribution

## Purpose

Connector API, definition and packaging are specified respectively by:

* [NDC specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/)
* [Deployment Specification](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub/blob/main/rfcs/0000-deployment.md)
* [Packaging Specification (WIP)](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub/pull/89/files)

This new distribution specification details how connector packages are intended to be owned, stored, indexed, searched, fetched and automatically published.

The intuition for this system is inspired by other package management systems such as NPM, Cabal, etc.
