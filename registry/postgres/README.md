## Overview

`ndc-postgres` provides a Hasura Data Connector to the PostgreSQL database,
which can expose and run GraphQL queries via the Hasura v3 Project.

The connector implements the [NDC Specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html),
but does not currently support mutations, column relationship arguments in queries, functions or procedures.
