With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in Oracle.
This connector supports Oracle's functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for efficient and scalable data
operations. Additionally, users benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data Delivery Network (DDN) platform,
including query pushdown capabilities that delegate query operations to the database, thereby enhancing query
optimization and performance.

This connector implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

## Using the Oracle connector

With the [context set](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_context_set/) for an existing subgraph, initialize
the connector:

```sh
ddn connector init -i
```

When the wizard runs, you'll be prompted to enter the following env vars necessary for your connector to function:

| Name         | Description                             | Required |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| JDBC_URL     | The JDBC URL to connect to the database | Yes      |
| JDBC_SCHEMAS | The SCHEMAS to introspect               | No       |


After the CLI initializes the connector, you'll need to:

- [Introspect](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect) the source.
- Add your [models](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_model_add),
  [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_command_add), and
  [relationships](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_relationship_add).
- Create a [new build](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local).
- Test it by [running your project along with the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_run#examples).
