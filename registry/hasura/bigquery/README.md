With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in
BigQuery. This connector supports BigQuery's functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for efficient and
scalable data operations. Additionally, users benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data Delivery Network
(DDN) platform, including query pushdown capabilities that delegate query operations to the database, thereby enhancing
query optimization and performance.

This connector is built using the [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk) and implements
the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector on your local machine (typically for development
purposes).You can learn how to deploy a connector to Hasura DDN — after it's been configured —
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Using the BigQuery connector

With the [context set](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_context_set/) for an existing subgraph, initialize
the connector by choosing `hasura/bigquery`. When the wizard runs, you'll also be prompted to enter the following env
vars necessary for your connector to function:

### Environment Variables

| Name                        | Description                                    | Required | Default |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_KEY | The service key of the BigQuery project        | Yes      | N/A     |
| HASURA_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID  | The project ID of the BigQuery databse project | Yes      | N/A     |
| HASURA_BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID  | The dataset ID of the BigQuery databse project | Yes      | N/A     |

After the CLI initializes the connector, you'll need to:

- [Introspect](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect) the source.
- Add your [models](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_model_add),
  [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_command_add), and
  [relationships](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_relationship_add).
- Create a [new build](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local).
- Test it by [running your project along with the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_run#examples).
