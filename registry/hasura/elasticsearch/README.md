With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your documents in
Elasticsearch. This connector supports Elasticsearch functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for efficient
and scalable data operations. Additionally, you will benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data Delivery
Network (DDN) platform, including query pushdown capabilities that delegate all query operations to the Elasticsearch,
thereby enhancing query optimization and performance.

This connector is built using the [Go Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-go) and implements the
[Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector on your local machine (typically for development
purposes).You can learn how to deploy a connector to Hasura DDN — after it's been configured —
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Using the Elasticsearch connector

With the [context set](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_context_set/) for an existing subgraph, initialize
the connector:

```sh
ddn connector init -i
```

When the wizard runs, you'll be prompted to enter the following env vars necessary for your connector to function:

| Environment Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Required | Example Value                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`           | The comma-separated list of Elasticsearch host addresses for connection (Use `local.hasura.dev` instead of `localhost` if your connector is running on your local machine) | Yes      | `https://example.es.gcp.cloud.es.io:9200`                      |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`      | The username for authenticating to the Elasticsearch cluster                                                                                                               | Yes      | `admin`                                                        |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`      | The password for the Elasticsearch user account                                                                                                                            | Yes      | `default`                                                      |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`       | The Elasticsearch API key for authenticating to the Elasticsearch cluster                                                                                                  | No       | `ABCzYWk0NEI0aDRxxxxxxxxxx1k6LWVQa2gxMUpRTUstbjNwTFIzbGoyUQ==` |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_CA_CERT_PATH`  | The path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for verifying the Elasticsearch server's SSL certificate                                                            | No       | `/etc/connector/cacert.pem`                                    |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PATTERN` | The pattern for matching Elasticsearch indices, potentially including wildcards, used by the connector                                                                     | No       | `hasura*`                                                      |

After the CLI initializes the connector, you'll need to:

- [Introspect](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect) the source.
- Add your [models](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_model_add),
  [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_command_add), and
  [relationships](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_relationship_add).
- Create a [new build](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local).
- Test it by [running your project along with the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_run#examples).
