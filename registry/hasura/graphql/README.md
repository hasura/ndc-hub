## Overview

The Hasura GraphQL Connector allows for connecting to a GraphQL API and bringing it into Hasura DDN supergraph as a single unified API. It can also be used to bring in your current Hasura v2 graphQL API into Hasura DDN and our recommended approach is to create a new subgraph for the v2 API.

For Hasura v2 users, this functionality is the replacement of [remote schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/remote-schemas/overview/) functionality in v3 (DDN).

The `ndc-graphql` data connector is open source and can be found in the [ndc-graphql GitHub repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-graphql). 

Visit the [Hasura v3 Documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/native-data-connectors) for more information.

## Deployment

The connector is hosted by Hasura and can be used from the [Hasura v3 CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/overview/) and [Console](https://console.hasura.io). Please follow either the [Quick Start Guide](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/overview/) or [deploying the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/connectors/deployment).
