## Overview

The NodeJS Lambda connector allows you to expose TypeScript functions as Commands in your Hasura DDN Supergraph.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector for local development. You can learn how to deploy a
connector — after it's been configured — [here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Using the NodeJS Lambda connector

Check out the [Hasura docs here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/business-logic/typescript#add-the-typescript-connector-to-a-project) to get started with the NodeJS Lambda connector.
