## Overview

`ndc-mongodb` provides a Hasura Data Connector to the MongoDB database,
which can expose and run GraphQL queries via the Hasura v3 Project.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-mongodb)

The connector implements the [NDC Specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html),
but does not currently support mutations, column relationship arguments in queries, functions or procedures.

## Using the MongoDB connector

Check out the [Hasura docs here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/with-mongodb) to get started with the MongoDB connector.
