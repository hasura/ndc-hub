## Overview, damn this works!

`ndc-mongodb` provides a Hasura Data Connector to the MongoDB database,
which can expose and run GraphQL queries via the Hasura v3 Project.

- [MongoDB Connector information in the Hasura Connectors directory](https://hasura.io/connectors/mongodb)
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-mongodb)

The connector implements the [NDC Specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html),
but does not currently support mutations, column relationship arguments in queries, functions or procedures.

Visit the
[Hasura v3 Documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/native-data-connectors/mongodb)
for more information.

## Usage

Follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/quickstart/)
to use the MongoDB data connector from the [Hasura v3 Console](https://console.hasura.io).
