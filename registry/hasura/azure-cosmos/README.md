With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in Azure
Cosmos DB for NoSQL Database containers. This connector supports Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL's functionalities listed in
the table below, allowing for efficient and scalable data operations.

This connector is built using the [TypeScript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript) and
implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector on your local machine (typically for development
purposes).You can learn how to deploy a connector to Hasura DDN — after it's been configured —
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Using the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL connector

With the [context set](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_context_set/) for an existing subgraph, initialize
the connector by choosing `hasura/azure-cosmos`. When the wizard runs, you'll also be prompted to enter the following
env vars necessary for your connector to function:

| Name                             | Description                                                                         | Required |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| AZURE_COSMOS_KEY                 | The Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL DB key                                                | Yes      |
| AZURE_COSMOS_DB_NAME             | Name of the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL DB                                            | Yes      |
| AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT            | Endpoint of the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL DB                                        | Yes      |
| AZURE_COSMOS_MANAGED_CLIENT_ID   | Managed client ID of the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL                                  | Yes      |
| AZURE_COSMOS_NO_OF_ROWS_TO_FETCH | Maximum number of rows to fetch per container to infer the schema of the container. | No       |

Note: `AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTOR_NO_OF_ROWS_TO_FETCH` is an optional field, with 100 rows to be fetched by default.

After the CLI initializes the connector, you'll need to:

- [Introspect](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect) the source.
- Add your [models](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_model_add),
  [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_command_add), and
  [relationships](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_relationship_add).
- Create a [new build](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local).
- Test it by [running your project along with the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_run#examples).
