With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in
Snowflake. This connector supports Snowflake's functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for efficient and
scalable data operations. Additionally, users benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data Delivery Network
(DDN) platform, including query pushdown capabilities that delegate query operations to the database, thereby enhancing
query optimization and performance.

This connector implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector on your local machine (typically for development
purposes).You can learn how to deploy a connector to Hasura DDN — after it's been configured —
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Using the Snowflake connector

With the [context set](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_context_set/) for an existing subgraph, initialize
the connector:

```sh
ddn connector init -i
```

When the wizard runs, you'll be prompted to enter the following env vars necessary for your connector to function:

| Name         | Description                                                  | Required |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| JDBC_URL     | The JDBC URL to connect to the database                      | Yes      |
| JDBC_SCHEMAS | A comma-separated list of schemas to include in the metadata | Yes      |

After the CLI initializes the connector, you'll need to:

- [Introspect](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect) the source.
- Add your [models](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_model_add),
  [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_command_add), and
  [relationships](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_relationship_add).
- Create a [new build](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local).
- Test it by [running your project along with the connector](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/commands/ddn_run#examples).
