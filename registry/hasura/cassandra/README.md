## Overview

`ndc-cassandra` provides a Hasura Data Connector to the Cassandra database,
which can expose and run GraphQL queries via the Hasura v3 Project.

- [Cassandra Connector information in the Hasura Connectors directory](https://hasura.io/connectors/cassandra)

The connector implements the [NDC Specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html),
but does not currently support mutations, column relationship arguments in queries, functions or procedures.
