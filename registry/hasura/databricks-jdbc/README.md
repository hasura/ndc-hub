With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in
Databricks. This connector supports Databricks functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for efficient and
scalable data operations. Additionally, users benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data Delivery Network
(DDN) platform, including query pushdown capabilities that delegate query operations to the database, thereby enhancing
query optimization and performance.

This connector implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io)
2. Please ensure you have the [DDN CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation) and
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
3. [Create a supergraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-supergraph)
4. [Create a subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/init-subgraph)

The steps below explain how to initialize and configure a connector on your local machine (typically for development
purposes).You can learn how to deploy a connector to Hasura DDN — after it's been configured —
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector).

## Build on Hasura DDN

[Get started](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-databricks) by connecting your Databricks workspace to a Hasura DDN project.
