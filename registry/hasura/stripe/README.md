# Stripe Connector

## Overview

The Stripe Data Connector provides an instant adapter for Hasura DDN to request Stripe resources via GraphQL. This connector is built upon the [HTTP connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-http) and [Stripe's OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/stripe/openapi).

## Build on Hasura DDN

[Get started](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-stripe) by connecting your Stripe account to a Hasura DDN project.

## Fork the connector

You can fork the [connector's repo](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-stripe) and iterate on it yourself.

## License

The Hasura Stripe connector is available under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
