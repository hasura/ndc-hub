With this connector, Hasura allows you to instantly create a real-time GraphQL API on top of your data models in
Phoenix. This connector supports Phoenix's functionalities listed in the table below, allowing for
efficient and scalable data operations. Additionally, users benefit from all the powerful features of Hasura’s Data
Delivery Network (DDN) platform, including query pushdown capabilities that delegate query operations to the database,
thereby enhancing query optimization and performance.

This connector implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).
