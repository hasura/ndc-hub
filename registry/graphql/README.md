## Overview

The GraphQL Native Data Connector allows for connecting to a GraphQL endpoint.
This uses the [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk) from the [Data connector Hub](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub) and implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

Please refer to the [Getting Started - Create an API](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/overview/) documentation if you get stuck during any of the steps outlined below.
