## Overview

`ndc-sqlserver` provides a Hasura Data Connector to the SQL Server database,
which can expose and run GraphQL queries via the Hasura v3 Project.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sqlserver)

The connector implements the [NDC Specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html),
but does not currently support mutations, column relationship arguments in queries, functions or procedures.

## Usage

Follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/quickstart/) 
to use the SQL Server data connector from the [Hasura v3 Console](https://console.hasura.io).
