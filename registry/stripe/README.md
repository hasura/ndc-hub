# Stripe Connector

## Overview

The Stripe Data Connector provides an instant adapter for Engine v3 to request Stripe resources via GraphQL. This connector is built upon the [REST connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-rest) and [Stripe's OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/stripe/openapi).

## Usage

Set the API key to `STRIPE_BEARER_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable and start the container. See all available variables [here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-stripe#environment-variables).
