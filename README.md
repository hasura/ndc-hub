# Hasura Native Data Connector Hub: ndc-hub

This repository provides:
1. A registry of connectors and 
2. Resources to help build connectors to connect new & custom data sources to Hasura. 

This allows Hasura users to instantly get a powerful Hasura GraphQL API (pagination, filtering, sorting, relationships) with granular RLS style authorization out of the box on any data-source (DBs, APIs).

> [!WARNING]
> NDC hub (the set of connectors and the SDK to build new connectors) is currently in alpha, and subject to breaking changes. It is shared here to provide an early preview of what can be expected for connector development & deployment in the future, and feedback is welcome! If you have any comments, please create an issue.

## Registry

There are 2 connectors you can start trying out today, and we'll gradually add more to this list:
1. [hasura/clickhouse](https://github.com/hasura/clickhouse_gdc_v2)
2. [hasura/weaviate](https://github.com/hasura/weaviate_gdc)

## SDK & Guides

### Connector Developer Guide

The best way to get started developing Hasura native data connectors is to [read the specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/) and familiarise yourself with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/tree/main/ndc-reference).

### Rusk SDK

This repository provides a Rust crate to aid development of [Hasura Native Data Connectors](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/). Developers can implement a trait, and derive an executable which can be used to run a connector which is compatible with the specification.

In addition, this library adopts certain conventions which are not covered by the current specification:

- Connector configuration
- State management
- Trace collection

#### Getting Started with the SDK

```sh
cargo build
```

#### Run the example connector

```sh
cargo run --bin ndc_hub_example -- \
  --configuration <(echo 'null')
```

Inspect the resulting (empty) schema:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8100/schema
```

(the default port 8100 can be changed using `--port`)
